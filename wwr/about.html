      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        We have 21 years providing unparalleled experiences to people, it all
        started with Jhon Water, our founder who loves these experiences wanted
        to share this with other people as a relaxation method, what he did not
        think was that it would be a resounding success, taking over the
        capacity limit Since it started, it grew like this with having
        employees, more boats and materials to enjoy a better experience until
        we reached what we have today.
